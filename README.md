# LibrarySDK

`LibrarySDK` is a lightweight Swift framework designed to send string data to a backend API via a simple and easy-to-use interface. The library includes built-in error handling and can be easily integrated into any iOS project.

## Features

- Send string data to a backend API.
- Handles empty string errors.
- Supports custom error handling for failed requests.
- Built-in Alamofire dependency for network communication.

## Requirements

- iOS 13.0+
- Xcode 12.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

To integrate `LibrarySDK` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, follow these steps:

1. **Install CocoaPods** (if not installed):

  ```sh
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```

2. **Add LibrarySDK to your Podfile: In your project's Podfile, add the following line, adjusting the path to where the LibrarySDK.framework and .podspec are located.\
  ```sh
   target 'YourAppTarget' do
   use_frameworks!
   # Add LibrarySDK from local path
   pod 'LibrarySDK', :path => '../path_to_your_local_framework'
   end
  ``` 
3. **Install the Pod: Run the following command in the terminal from the root directory of your project:

  ```sh
  pod install
  ```
4. **Open the .xcworkspace file generated by CocoaPods:

  ```sh
  open YourApp.xcworkspace
  ```
Now, LibrarySDK is integrated into your project and ready to use.

### Example Usage

1. Import the LibrarySDK: In any class where you want to use LibrarySDK, import the framework:
  ```sh
  import LibrarySDK
  ```

2. Send a String to the Backend: You can send a string to the backend API using the `sendString` method. This method requires the string to send and a completion handler to handle the result.
Here's a full example:

  ```sh
import UIKit
import LibrarySDK

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Sending a string to the backend
        LibrarySDK.shared.sendString("Hello, LibrarySDK!") { result in
            switch result {
            case .success:
                print("String sent successfully!")
            case .failure(let error):
                print("Failed to send string: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            }
        }
    }
}
  ```

### `sendString Method`
The sendString method is the core function of LibrarySDK. It allows you to send a string to the backend API and handles success and failure cases.

Method Signature:
  ```sh
public func sendString(_ string: String, completion: @escaping (Result<Bool, Error>) -> Void)
  ```

#### Parameters:

- `string: String:` The string you want to send to the backend. This string cannot be empty. If an empty string is passed, the method will return an error.
- `completion: @escaping (Result<Bool, Error>) -> Void`: A closure that will be called when the operation is completed. The closure returns a `Result` type that can either be `.success` or `.failure`.

#### Completion Handler:

The `completion` handler returns a `Result` type:

- `success(Bool)`: Indicates that the string was successfully sent to the backend.
    - The boolean value will always be `true` if the request is successful.
      
- `failure(Error)`: Indicates that there was an error during the operation. The error can be:
    - Invalid URL: If the URL used in the request is malformed.
    - Empty String: If an empty string is provided.
    - Network Error: If the network request fails for any reason, such as no internet connection or the server being unavailable.

### Example of Handling an Empty String:
If you attempt to send an empty string, LibrarySDK will return an error. You can handle it like this:
  ```sh
LibrarySDK.shared.sendString("") { result in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        print("This should not happen for an empty string.")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)") // Error: String cannot be empty.
    }
}

  ```

### Error Handling
The `sendString` method handles different types of errors, including:

- Empty String: Returns an error with domain `"Empty String"` and code `-3` if an empty string is provided.
- Invalid URL: If the backend URL is not valid, the completion handler returns an error with code `-1`.
- Network Error: Any network-related errors will be propagated through the completion handler.

### Networking
This SDK relies on `Alamofire` for making HTTP network requests. Ensure that you have Alamofire installed in your project if you're extending the functionality of the SDK.
